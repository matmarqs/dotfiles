# dwm build of my home pc

### The following patches were applied in order in my dwm build.

It is a vanity_gaps combo with a lot of layouts.
* 1: vanitygaps + layouts         971 L
* 2: swallow,                     412 L
* 3: pertag,                      177 L
* 4: cyclelayouts,                 93 L
* 5: rotatetags                    77 L
* 6: push_no_master,               70 L
* 7: actualfullscreen,             68 L
* 8: fixborders,                   27 L

Depois disso eu comentei um monte de funções do
vanity_gaps (e também focusmon, tagmon) para
deixá-los menos bloated.
