# my dwm build

The original source code and patches can be found at [suckless](https://dwm.suckless.org/).

### The following patches were applied in order

It is a vanitygaps combo with a lot of layouts.
* 1: vanitygaps + layouts,        971 L
* 2: swallow,                     412 L
* 3: pertag,                      177 L
* 4: cyclelayouts,                 93 L
* 5: rotatetags,                   77 L
* 6: pushnomaster,                 70 L
* 7: actualfullscreen,             68 L
* 8: fixborders,                   27 L

After that, I commented a lot of vanitygaps functions (and focusmon, tagmon) to simplify a little.
